# The Template

### Introduction
This project has been created as a template for general use and to showcase its design and functionality. It does not contain any actual links or related images; it serves solely as a foundational template that can be adapted to specific needs.

### Disclaimer
This code is a personal project crafted with dedication. While the core logic and design are my own, Iâ€™ve taken the help of AI tools for correcting logical errors and refining the GUI to enhance the overall user experience. 

## [Update] Repository Restored
